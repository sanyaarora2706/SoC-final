Checkpoint 1 (11th April, 2021)
We learnt the basics of python and learnt about numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

Task 1 (ID: A1)-
We implemented functions from pandas and numpy  to find required data from the given dataset. We learnt how to work with series, dataframes, etc.

Task 2 (ID: A2)-
In this task, we used the matplotlib library to plot histograms, and other graphs using values from the given dataset. We also found the mean, variance, median,standard deviation etc for different variables.

Checkpoint 2 (8th June, 2021)

Task 4 (ID: B3)-
Here we made a live age and gender detector which uses the cv2 library and pre-trained Caffe models.

Task 5 (ID: B4)-
The program written for this task detects the age and gender of the people appearing in youtube video. The output video with the box-frame and predicted age, gender gets downloaded.

Final Phase: Checkpoint 3 (18th July, 2021)
Task 6 (ID: C1)-
Through this task we were introduced to app development and we learnt about how TensorFlowLite and the Android Studio works(involved a lot of debugging xD). We made an android app that uses the phone camera to estimate the age and gender. We learnt how to convert a Keras neural network into TensorFlowLite format and run it on android devices.

Task 7(ID: C2)-
We learnt how to perform facial recognition using OpenCV, python and deep learning on google colab. Here we used the dlib library and face_recognition module that outputs a list of 128 real-valued numbers that are used to quantify a face. Our dataset is made of characters from the movie 'Jurassic World', 'Jurassic Park'. This program will be able to recognise these characters in both image and video format. It also creates a cluster/montage of similar faces.
